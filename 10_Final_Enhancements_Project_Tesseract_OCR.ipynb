This revolutionary approach harnesses the power of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to decipher ingredient labels, enabling the algorithm to swiftly identify excessive quantities of substances such as fats and concentrated sugars.\n",

As the algorithm detects surges in these substances, it promptly issues alerts to users, effectively serving as a real-time safeguard against potentially harmful consumption. Beyond alerts, the system augments user comprehension by visually representing ingredient proportions through interactive graphs or charts. This visualization focuses attention on the harmful constituents, like fats and sugars, rendering them in bold indices for clear distinction.\n",
